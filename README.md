# JDK_Script

This repository contains a Windows batch script for switching between different JDK versions directly from the command line. It simplifies the process of managing multiple Java Development Kits on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before using the scripts, ensure you have multiple versions of the JDK installed on your Windows machine.

## Installation

To use the script from the command line, follow these steps to add the scripts' folder to your environment variables:

1. Open the Start Search, type in `Environment Variables`, and select **Edit the system environment variables**.
2. In the System Properties window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.
3. Under the System variables section, scroll down and select the **Path** variable, then click **Edit**.
4. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click **New** and add the path to the folder that contains the scripts.
5. Click **OK** on all windows to apply the changes.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can easily switch between JDK versions by opening Command Prompt (CMD) and typing `JDK` followed by the version number you wish to activate. For example:

- To switch to JDK 8, type `JDK8`.
- To switch to JDK 11, type `JDK11`.

Replace "8" and "11" with the version number you need to switch to, based on the JDK versions you have installed.
